"""
The Hash Table is a data structure that stores elements in a series of slots (or buckets).
Each slot has a unique identifying key. Hash Tables usually contain a number of slots
equal to a prime number because they have few common factors: it prevents collisions.
A 'hash' takes a number (or a group of characters) and performs an arithmetic or logical
transformation to produce a value (i.e. modulo division). A collision happens when more
than one element should belong to the same index.
In Python, Hash Tables are implemented behind the scene by the dictionary.
