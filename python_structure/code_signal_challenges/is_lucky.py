> Task
Ticket numbers usually consist of an even number of digits. A ticket number is considered lucky
if the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half. Given a ticket
number n, determine if it's lucky or not.

> Example
For n = 1230, the output should be true
For n = 239017, the output should be false.

> Input/Output
- execution time limit: 4 seconds (py3)
- input: integer n
A ticket number represented as a positive integer with an even number of digits.
- guaranteed constraints:
10 â‰¤ n < 106.
- output: boolean
true if n is a lucky ticket number, false otherwise.
